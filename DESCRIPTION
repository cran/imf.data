Description: A straightforward interface for accessing the IMF 
    (International Monetary Fund) data JSON API, 
    available at <https://data.imf.org/>. This package offers direct access to 
    the primary API endpoints: Dataflow, DataStructure, and CompactData. 
    And, it provides an intuitive interface for exploring available 
    dimensions and attributes, as well as querying individual time-series datasets. 
    Additionally, the package implements a rate limit on API calls to reduce the 
    chances of exceeding service limits (limited to 10 calls every 5 seconds) 
    and encountering response errors.
